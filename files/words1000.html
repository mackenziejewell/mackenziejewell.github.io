I study ice that forms on the world's large water area at the top of the world. During the coldest and darkest parts of the year, the water area gets really cold and becomes completely covered by ice. In summer, the sun warms some of the ice back into water. The remaining ice is important for keeping the world cool, since the large area of bright white ice sends lots of sun light back into space. From year to year, the ice cover at the big top-of-the-world water area changes: both in the total area and where the ice is found. As the world has gotten warmer, much of the ice has become less thick and has spent more time in its water form than it used to. With less bright ice covering the water, the water takes in more warm sun light, and this makes the top of the world even warmer. Because of this, the top of the world is warming and changing much faster than the rest of the world. And these changes cause other changes in the air, water, and land all over. So, it's really important that we learn everything we can about what causes changes to the ice cover.</p>


One of the hard parts about understanding what causes changes in the ice (now and later in time) is that it is also moving around every second of every day. Above and under the ice, winds and moving water push and pull on the ice. They move the ice to new places and sometimes cause it to break into pieces or become thicker. The moving ice is sometimes pushed against land at the the edges of the big water area. When the ice touches the land edges, it can make it harder to move the ice, and it also makes it harder to know ahead of time how winds and moving waters will cause the ice to move.

I work on understanding a small piece of this big not-known story. I study how winds move top-of-the-world ice around from day to day, as well as how the land edges around the water area sometimes stop the winds from moving the ice as easily. Since it can be hard to visit the ice-covered top of the world to study it, I use computers in space that can see this part of the world. The space computers tell us what's going on with the ice there every day. Other computers can tell us what the winds are like there each day. I use what both of these computers tell us to learn what winds have caused which ice to move and to break where. By figuring out how this has happened so far, it will be easier to make better guesses how the ice will move and change from now on.Â
