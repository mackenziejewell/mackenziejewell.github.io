I study ice that forms on top of the large water area at the top of the world. During the coldest and darkest parts of the year, the top-of-the-world water area gets so cold it becomes completely covered by ice. Every summer, the sun warms some of this ice cover back into water. The remaining ice area is important for keeping the world cool, since bright white ice sends warm sun light back into space. The ice is also very important for the lives of people and animals that live on, under, and around the big ice-covered area.</p> 
    
As the world becomes warmer, much of the ice is becoming less thick and spending more time in its water form than it did in the past. With less bright ice now covering the water, the water area takes in more sun light and warms more ice into water. This repeats, going round and round and causing the ice to disappear. The disappearing ice and warming at the top of the world is causing other changes in the air, water, and land all around the world. In order to have good guesses of what the world will look like down the line, it's important that we learn what is causing changes to the ice cover now.</p>


One of the hard parts about understanding what causes changes in the ice is that it is also moving around every second of every day. Above and under the ice, winds and moving water push and pull on the ice. Winds and water can move ice to new places, and even cause it to crack open or push it together until it becomes thicker. Moving ice is sometimes pushed against other pieces of ice or against land at the edges of the water area, making it harder to move the ice. This also makes it harder to know ahead of time how winds and moving waters will cause the ice to move.</p>

I work on better understanding a small piece of this big story that is not completely known yet. I study how winds move top-of-the-world ice around from day to day, as well as how land around the water area sometimes stop the winds from moving the ice as easily. Since it can be hard to visit the ice-covered top of the world in order to study it, I use computers in space that can see this part of the world. From pictures made by the space computers, people who study this area share what's going on there with the ice every day. I use what they show to figure out how wind, water, and land have caused the ice to move and crack in different ways. By figuring out how this has happened so far, it will be easier to make better guesses how the ice will continue to move and change tomorrow.
